## üìù Overview

This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices for the ScaleMate platform. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, compliance requirements, and incident response procedures.

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and services
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features enabled by default
4. **Fail Secure**: System fails in a secure state
5. **Security by Design**: Security built into the development process
6. **Regular Audits**: Continuous security monitoring and assessment
7. **Incident Readiness**: Prepared response to security incidents
8. **User Education**: Security awareness and training

## üîê Authentication

### User Authentication

#### Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- No common words or patterns
- Regular password rotation
- Password history enforcement

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Required for all admin accounts
- Optional for regular users
- Support for:
  - Authenticator apps
  - SMS codes
  - Email codes
  - Hardware tokens

#### Session Management
- JWT-based sessions
- Configurable session timeouts
- Concurrent session limits
- Session invalidation on password change
- Remember me functionality

### Service Authentication

#### API Authentication
- JWT tokens for API access
- API key management
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party integration
- Token rotation policies
- Scope-based access

#### Service-to-Service Authentication
- Mutual TLS (mTLS)
- Service accounts
- Role-based access
- Automated key rotation
- Access logging

## üëÆ Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles
- Super Admin
- Admin
- Manager
- User
- Guest

#### Role Permissions
```typescript
interface RolePermissions {
  users: {
    create: boolean;
    read: boolean;
    update: boolean;
    delete: boolean;
  };
  teams: {
    create: boolean;
    read: boolean;
    update: boolean;
    delete: boolean;
  };
  workflows: {
    create: boolean;
    read: boolean;
    update: boolean;
    delete: boolean;
  };
  // ... other resources
}
```

### Resource-Level Permissions

#### Team-Based Access
- Team membership required
- Team role determines access
- Resource ownership
- Sharing capabilities
- Inheritance rules

#### Data Access Controls
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Column-level encryption
- Data masking
- Audit logging
- Access reviews

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Security

### Data Classification

#### Sensitivity Levels
1. **Public**: Non-sensitive data
2. **Internal**: Company-internal data
3. **Confidential**: Sensitive business data
4. **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data

#### Handling Requirements

- Storage locations
- Access controls
- Retention periods
- Disposal procedures

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
