### Resolved Issues
*No resolved issues yet*

## Technical Debt

1. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Missing API documentation for planned endpoints
   - Incomplete component documentation
   - Need for more detailed setup guides

2. **Code Quality**
   - Inconsistent naming conventions in some areas
   - Missing type definitions for some components
   - Need for more comprehensive error handling

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Low test coverage for utility functions
   - Missing integration tests for API endpoints
   - Need for more comprehensive UI testing

## Active Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Next.js with TypeScript for frontend
   - Supabase for backend and authentication
   - Tailwind CSS with ShadCN for UI components
   - React Query for data fetching
   - Zustand for state management

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Atomic design for components
   - Server-side rendering for initial page loads
   - Edge Functions for compute-intensive operations

3. **Development Process**
   - Git flow with feature branches
   - Pull request reviews required for all changes
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Continuous deployment to staging environment

## Current Challenges

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Balancing TypeScript strictness with development speed
   - Optimizing Supabase queries for complex data relationships
   - Managing state across feature boundaries
   - Implementing efficient caching strategies

2. **Process Challenges**
   - Ensuring consistent code quality across the team
   - Maintaining up-to-date documentation
   - Coordinating frontend and backend development
   - Managing dependencies and version updates

## Resource Allocation

1. **Development Team**
   - 2 Frontend Developers
   - 1 Backend Developer
   - 1 Full-stack Developer
   - 1 UI/UX Designer

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Development environment on local machines
   - Staging environment on Vercel
   - Production environment on Vercel (planned)
   - Supabase project for database and authentication

3. **Tools and Services**
   - GitHub for version control
   - Vercel for deployment
   - Supabase for backend
   - OpenAI for AI integration
   - Postmark for email

## Feature Flags

The following feature flags are available for development:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE` - Enables development-only features (default: ON)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_QUOTE_PREVIEW` - Enables the Quick Quote Calculator preview
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_ANON_EVENTS` - Allows anonymous users to trigger events

Usage in code:
```typescript
if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_X_ENABLED) {
  // Feature-specific code
}
```

## Test Platform

The following test pages are available for isolated feature testing:

- `/test/auth.tsx` - Test authentication flows
- `/test/quote.tsx` - Test Quick Quote Calculator
- `/test/quiz.tsx` - Test Readiness Quiz
- `/test/role.tsx` - Test Role Builder Wizard

**Important**: Never run untested features in live dashboards until marked ‚úÖ Ready in this document.

## Event Tracking

All user interactions should log events to the `user_events` table with the following structure:

```typescript
interface UserEvent {
  user_id: string | null; // null for anonymous users
  event_type: string;
  event_data: Record<string, any>;
  created_at: Date;
}
```

Common event types:
- `quote_viewed`
- `quote_calculated`
- `quiz_submitted`
- `tool_opened`
- `course_started`
- `resource_downloaded`
- `profile_updated`
- `badge_earned`

Example implementation:
```typescript
const logEvent = async (eventType: string, eventData: Record<string, any>) => {
  await supabase.from('user_events').insert({
    user_id: user?.id || null,
    event_type: eventType,
    event_data: eventData,
  });
};
```

## Behavior Guidelines

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Never remove completed history ‚Äî archive into "Done This Sprint" section
   - Always update feature status when changes are made
   - Document all API endpoints and component props

2. **Sprint Management**
   - Always confirm if a feature belongs in the current sprint
   - Update sprint goals when priorities change
   - Track progress against sprint goals

3. **Issue Tracking**
   - When a bug is fixed, move it from "Known Issues" to "Resolved Issues"
   - Add new issues as they are discovered
   - Assign issues to team members

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Create test pages for all new features
   - Ensure test coverage for all business logic
   - Flag low test coverage in Technical Debt section

## New Feature Requirements

Before adding a new feature, confirm:
1. Is it part of the current sprint?
2. Is there a tracking test page?
3. Has a placeholder for logic, state, and events been created?
4. Has this document been updated with feature progress and ownership?

## Notes and Observations

- Focus on clean architecture and maintainable code
- Prioritize testability in all components
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Follow best practices for security and performance
- Regular code reviews to ensure quality
- Weekly team syncs to address blockers
- Bi-weekly planning sessions to adjust priorities
